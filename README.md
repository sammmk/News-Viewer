# News-Viewer

This a news showing app which is using [google news api](https://newsapi.org/).
I have included my private developer mode api key, If anyone want to use this project, please generate your own api key 🙇🏽.
It's pretty simple 😁. 

## Current development
* Showing `all` news articles which we can be received from the API.
* For the list view (Current Home view), image icon, title and source of the news is displayed.

## ToDo
* Add tab view for the Home view and add more categories. 
* Research and add some animations 🤔.
* Create native view instead of web view (Not for the whole article, but for summarized content). ⬅ may be this is stupid...
